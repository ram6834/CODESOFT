## 1.To-Do List Application

 To-Do List application using Python and the Tkinter library. 🐍✨

📋 This application allows users to:

▪️ ➕ Add tasks

# 💻 Brief Explanation:

The application uses Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The list of tasks is displayed in a listbox, and users can add, update, or delete tasks using the corresponding buttons. This project has helped me improve my Python programming and GUI development skills.
