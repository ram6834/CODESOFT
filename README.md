These are the TASKS / PROJECTS for CODESOFT Internship 

## 1.To-Do List Application

 To-Do List application using Python and the Tkinter library. 🐍✨

📋 This application allows users to:

▪️ ➕ Add tasks
▪️ ✏️ Update existing tasks
▪️ 🗑️ Delete tasks

### 💻 Brief Explanation:

The application uses Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The list of tasks is displayed in a listbox, and users can add, update, or delete tasks using the corresponding buttons. This project has helped me improve my Python programming and GUI development skills.


## 2.Simple Calculator

 1️⃣ Addition
 2️⃣ Subtraction 
 3️⃣ Multiplication 
 4️⃣ Division
 5️⃣ Modular Division

 ### 💡 How it works:
-> Prompts the user to choose an operation.
-> Takes two numerical inputs.
-> Performs the chosen arithmetic operation.
-> Displays the result, handling errors like invalid inputs and division by zero gracefully.


## 3.Rock Paper Scissors game

Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python! 🐍🎮 This fun and interactive game allows you to play multiple rounds against the computer, with real-time score tracking.

 Here’s a quick overview of the code:

### How it works :

Random Computer Choice: The computer randomly selects between rock, paper, and scissors using Python's random.choice() function. 🎲

User Input: The game prompts the user to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and handles invalid inputs gracefully. 📝

Game Logic: The code compares the user’s choice with the computer’s choice to determine the winner, implementing the classic rules:

- Rock 🪨 beats Scissors ✂️
- Scissors ✂️ beat Paper 📄
- Paper 📄 beats Rock 🪨

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of both the user's and the computer's scores across multiple rounds. 📊

Play Again Option: After each round, the user is asked if they want to play again, making the game loop seamlessly until the user decides to stop. 🔄

📈 Final Scores: At the end of the game, the final scores are displayed along with a message indicating the overall winner. 🏆
